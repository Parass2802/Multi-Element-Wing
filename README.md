# Multi-Element-Wing
Framework for Tuning the Setup of an Inverted Double-Element Airfoil in Ground Effect using Improved HHO and Kriging Surrogate Model

RANS simulations using Ansys Fluent 2022 R1 were used for training the Kriging surrogate model. The trained surrogate model was then utilized by the Improved Harris Hawks Optimization algorithm to optimize the geometric parameters of the system, i.e., the ground height, flap overlap, flap gap, and the flap angle.
